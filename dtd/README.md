# The nvcx DTD

If you want to validate a `.nvcx` file, you can copy the latest DTD file
into your project directory.

**Note:** Since the *nv_collection* plugin does not validate the collection files, 
this DTD is not needed for your daily work. However, it can be useful developing
of third-party applications and tools that read or write `.nvcx` files.
