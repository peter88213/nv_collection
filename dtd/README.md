# The nvcx DTD

If you want to validate a *.nvcx* file, you can copy the latest DTD file
into your project directory.

Since the XML parser used with *nv_collection* is not validating, the DTD is not 
associated with *.nvcx* files by a DOCTYPE statement. 

The DTD file provided here is for information only. However, the DTD major 
and minor version numbers are used as an element attribute, so any application 
can use them for compatibility checks.
