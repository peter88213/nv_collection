    <Desc>
      <p>Many years have passed since the last engineers of mankind set off with the spaceship Governant Hive to colonize a distant planet. They were never heard from again. In the meantime, Earth is threatened with a climate catastrophe and the engineers' know-how is badly missed. Captain Conner has been assigned to locate the Governor Hive and return it to Earth.
